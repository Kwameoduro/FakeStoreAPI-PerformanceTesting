# Performance Testing with Apache JMeter

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on assessing the **performance, scalability, and reliability** of the [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/) web application using **Apache JMeter**.  

The tests simulate real-world user scenarios (login, search, add to cart, checkout) under varying loads to evaluate:
- **Response Times**
- **Throughput**
- **Error Rates**
- **Scalability**

The ultimate goal is to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the application meets the defined performance requirements.

---

## Objectives
- Validate responsiveness of critical user journeys.
- Ensure throughput of **≥ 500 requests per second** under peak load.
- Confirm error rate remains **≤ 1%** during execution.
- Evaluate system scalability and stability under load and endurance conditions.
